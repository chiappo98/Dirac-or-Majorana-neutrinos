\begin{abstract}
In this paper I will present the state of the research on neutrinos, together with several still open questions. In particular our focus will be set on wether neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles. In the end we will describes the experiments that attempt to observe a neutrinoless double beta decay in even-even nuclei%~\ref{}
, which will prove the Majorana nature of these particles.
\end{abstract}

\section{An elusive particle}
\subsection{History}
The neutrino was first theorized in 1930 by Wolfgang Pauli in order to account for conservation of energy and momentum in beta decays.
At the beginning thes processes were though to proceed as
\[
^A_Z X\rightarrow ^A_{Z+1}Y+e^-
\]
However looking at the energy spectrum of emitted electrons (\emph{Fig.}~\ref{fig:betaD}) it was clear that it was due to a three body process, but then a particle was missed!

It had to be a neutral and low-interacting particle, in other words... a neutrino.

\subsection{Neutrinos production and interaction}
Neutrinos are spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions, with charge $q=0$  and, according to the Standard Model (SM) they are massless. Being neutral leptons they interact only through weak interactions, and hence are very difficult to detect.

Here is a lettered array~(\ref{e.all}), with eqs.~(\ref{e.house})
and~(\ref{e.phi}):
\begin{eqnletter}
 \label{e.all}
 \drm x_\sy{F} & = & 1.2\cdot10^3\un{cm}, \qquad
                     \tx{where\ } \sy{F} = \tx{Fermi}    \label{e.house}\\
 \phi_i        & = & i\pi                                \label{e.phi}
